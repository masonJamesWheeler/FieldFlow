# FieldFlow: The UW NCAA Football Play Creation and Sharing Platform

Welcome to the code repository for FieldFlow, a special project tailored for the University of Washington NCAA Football. In my spare time, I am actively developing this web application, which is uniquely designed to facilitate the creation and sharing of football plays among the UW Football coaches and their players. 

It's important to note that this README may not be fully synchronized with the latest state of the project due to its active development and the intent to maintain a degree of secrecy around the newest features for the protection of the UW Football playbook.
