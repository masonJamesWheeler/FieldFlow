This is a repo for a project I work on in my spare time. It is a website written in svelte with
over 20 pages and some fun implementations written for HTML Canvas. The end goal of the website is to 
let collegiate and high-school football coaches quickly make plays and share them with their players.

Features include:
Drawing plays,
auto-alignment for scout cards
Install creation
Playbook Creation
Playbook sharing
Subscription based implementations
and more!


Backend is largely supported by Firebase and the frontend is written in Svelte with typescript.
