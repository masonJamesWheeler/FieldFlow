# FieldFlow: A Football Play Creation and Sharing Platform

This repository hosts the code for FieldFlow, a project I am actively developing in my spare time. FieldFlow is a web application designed to facilitate the creation and sharing of football plays among collegiate and high-school football coaches and their players. 

Please note that this README may not be up-to-date with the current state of the project as it is under active development.

...and more!

## Technology Stack

FieldFlow's frontend is built with Svelte and TypeScript, offering a modern, reactive user interface. The backend is largely supported by Firebase, providing a scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage and retrieval. 

Stay tuned for more updates as the project evolves!
